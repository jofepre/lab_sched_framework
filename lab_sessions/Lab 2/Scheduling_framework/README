This package provides an scheduling framework aimed at lab sessions of
computer architecture courses. The scheduling framework uses the libpfm4
library to access and collet performance counters. 


WHAT'S THERE
-------------
	- The scheduling framework source code is in libpfm-4.8.0/scheduling_framework

	- Since the scheduling framework uses the libpfm4 library to access 
	  performance counters, this package also includes its source code. 
	  Building the framework upon the libpfm4 package allows an easier and
	  direct compilation of the project. 

INSTALLATION
------------
	- edit config.mk to :
		- update some of the configuration variables
		- select your compiler options

	- type make
	- type make install

	The above instructions will compile and install the libpfm4 library and 
	will compile the scheduling framework.
	

DOCUMENTATION
-------------
	- Please, refer to the libpfm-4.8.0/scheduling_framework/README for
	  further documentation about the scheduling framework.

	- Please, refer to libpfm-4.8.0/README for further documentation and
